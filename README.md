# SelfScheduled_Neural_Clustering
Neural Clustering Architecture for Tabular Data (Customer Segmentation/Persona Creation)
This repo contains the neural architecture proposed in [____]. 

## 1.1: How to use on your own dataset
The file "SelfScheduled_Neural_Clustering.ipynb" contains an example for running the network and includes code for you to run it on your own dataset.
This file is a Google Colab Notebook, so all the code is already written for you:

- 1. Click "SelfScheduled_Neural_Clustering.ipynb" 
- 2. Click "Open in Colab" at the top
- 3. Follow the instructions in the notebook
